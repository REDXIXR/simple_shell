##Environment :evergreen_tree::evergreen_tree:

Our shell was built and tested on  Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

### Basic usage
- First, [fork this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).
- Then [clone it to your local machine](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
- Create an executable by running the following command:
- `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh`
- From there, type in the following command and press your enter button.
- `./hsh`
